## LIMS Multi User Chat portlet properties file

## Important: Never modify this file directly. Always create separate portlet-ext.properties
##            file where you can override properties from the portlet.properties file
##

##
## Properties Override
##

    #
    # Specify where to get the overridden properties. Updates should not be made
    # on this file but on the overridden version of this file.
    #
    include-and-override = portlet-ext.properties


##
## Version
##

    #
    # Version of the portlet
    #
    # Note: Do not modify
    #
    version = v1.2.0 MUC

##
## Properties source
##

    #
    # Specifies the source of properties. There are two possible values: "preferences" and "properties".
    # If set to "preferences" all properties are set via the admin area in settings panel. If set to
    # "properties" the admin area is switched off and properties are read from the portlet.properties file.
    #
    properties.source = preferences

##
## Excluded
##

    #
    # Specify a list of comma delimited site names where the portlet shouldn't be displayed.
    # Administrator will always see the portlet anywhere. Portlet is not displayed in
    # Control Panel by default

## Contact List
##

    #
    # Specify the strategy to generate the list of buddies available in the chat
    # list. The value of "all" will include all users in a portal instance. Note that
    # only users that have logged into the system in the past will be included.
    # The value of "sites" will include all users that belong to sites that a user
    # also belongs to. The value of "social" will include all users based on the
    # user's social relations and the allowed social relation types defined in
    # the property "buddy.list.allowed.social.relation.types". The value of
    # "sites,social" will include a combined list of users from the values of
    # "sites" and "social".
    # If you set the property to "jabber" LIMS will load users from the user's roster on Jabber server.
    # Note that only the users that are also in Liferay's user repository will be shown.
    # The "jabber" setting works only if the jabber.enabled property is set to true.

    # Specify a list of comma delimited site names that are excluded from

## Jabber

    # automatically to Jabber after he logins to the portal. Once the user is imported, he can use any
    # Jabber client using the same screen name and password he uses to login to the portal. His buddies
    # will be also imported as they become online in the chat portlet.
    #
    # Note that it's a "lazy import". Users are imported only after they login to the portal and
    # their buddies will be added to his list only if they see each other within the chat portlet.

    #
    # If jabber.import.user.enabled is set to false, users will need to create their
    # Jabber account and add buddies manually, they need to create their accounts using the same
    # screen name and password they use in the portal, otherwise the chat portlet won't be able
    # to connect to their Jabber account.
